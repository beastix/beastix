This is the documentation collection of the cdrkit package

It has been derived from the cdrtools package maintained by
Joerg Schilling.  However, other maintainers work on this
spinoff of the documentation.

Keep in mind that cdrkit is not cdrtools when you read the
documentation. Some details may be void in context of
cdrkit.
