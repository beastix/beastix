GENERAL NOTE:

This package is heavily based on cdrtools (by Jörg
Schilling, see below), however he is not affiliated
with the debburn development project creating this package.

Cdrtools (see http://cdrecord.berlios.de) 2.01.01a08 from May 2006 was
the version used as the starting code base for cdrkit.

Jörg Schilling is not responsible for problems caused by the
use or distribution of this software. Please avoid bothering
him with issues that are out of his control.

Kudos to the original authors, especially Jörg Schilling, but for
various reasons we decided that we can only continue to have a burning
suite without license incompatibilities. For more details about this
please read the file FORK.
